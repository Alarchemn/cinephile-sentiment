0,Harakiri,1962,Masaki Kobayashi,"
Down-on-his-luck veteran Tsugumo Hanshirō enters the courtyard of the prosperous House of Iyi. Unemployed, and with no family, he hopes to find a place to commit seppuku—and a worthy second to deliver the coup de grâce in his suicide ritual. The senior counselor for the Iyi clan questions the ronin’s resolve and integrity, suspecting Hanshirō of seeking charity rather than an honorable end. What follows is a pair of interlocking stories which lay bare the difference between honor and respect, and promises to examine the legendary foundations of the Samurai code.

This is remarkable. It’s a film that raises a lot of issues about whether fervent loyalty to the code of honour is more valuable than humanity. And how that is unjustifiable. The execution is masterful, and the pay-off is even better. The resolution is entirely cathartic. It’s also incredibly well-choreographed, touching, and surprisingly exciting. I do think that I will need another watch in order to fully digest everything, though. ***', ' God damn what an impeccable film. Not dated in the least, if you tried to tell this same story now, 60 years later, this would still be the best way to tell it, shot for shot, line for line.I sometimes get intimidated by the fact that there is so much great film, both past and present, that I could never find time to see it all. Japan alone has way too many incredible filmmakers with extensive filmographies I’ve barely scraped the surface of. I don’t know what was in the water over there throughout the 20th century, but it must’ve been good. ***', ' Probably the greatest film ever.. a film about honour, valour, poverty, hunger , justice and the politics.. a fable that is as relevant today as when it was made.. totally blown ***', ' Immediately pulls you in with its captivating simultaneous story-telling, which rings of mystery and intrigue as the plot thickens and builds. There’s so much beauty in intimate and heartbreaking dialogue, and this films display of powerful rhetoric, equally as thoughtful as it can be emotionally jarring, is absolute class. Everything builds as an eerie and heart-pounding score adds layers of uncertainty to an already nervous experience. This all builds to our final few sequences which mesmerized me and solidified Harakiri as not only the greatest samurai film ever made, but one of the best films ever made. ***', ' ""Who can fathom the depths of another man\'s heart?"" ***', ' wait can we normalize calling something you’ve only seen once, your favorite movie of all time? ***', ' Went in with high expectations and boy were they fucking fulfilled. The word masterpiece is thrown around a lot, often too much, but in the case of Harakiri its 110% justified. Simply astonishing. ***', "" it's frankly quite embarrassing how often I find myself at a loss for words, but it's a consolation to know that when this film is concerned, words probably wouldn't even come close to doing it justice anyway ***"", ' ""...a man of some acquaintance to me.""my first masaki kobayashi film dares me to review it, knowing i cant. some shots tell more stories, reveal more history, and immortalize myths better than any scene involving dialogue ever could. i want my heart back, masaki kobayashi. ***', ' a japanese action samurai movie about a dude trying to kill himself the director made this movie for me he told me himself!! ***', "" Ain't got much to say here to be honest. It's just one of the greatest films ever made isn't it?If you've seen it then you know and if you haven't just do yourself a favour and go watch this classic. ***"", ' Both Spider-verses are better than this94/100 ***', ' The resolve of the broken in the face of expiry. A partition of prestige veils the sanctimonious. One man willing to sacrifice his life for his own personal cause; Hanshirō dedicated everything to a morality that ruthlessly betrayed him, and in setting out to take his revenge, he reveals the moral hypocrisies of Bushidō, which prove to be more damning to his antagonists than any amount of malefic bloodshed he could inflict.But blood will be spilled. It will rain crimson at the feet of their Gods, and no attempts at swift concealment can ever suture the gaping wounds revealed by the truth. ***', "" How dare Masaki Kobayashi steal the climatic scene from Kill Bill without giving it credit? What a shameless man. This film should be avoided at all- just joking. Hara-kiri is japanese filmmaking at its best, fascinating use of lighting and music. 20 minutes in and I've already decided that this film is definitely going into my top 10 best films of all time list, exceeding both Seven Samurai and Rashomon. Going to give Takashi Miike's remake a try. I fucking love samurais, man. ***"", ' Great movie but every time they name-dropped the ""Sengoku clan"" all I could think about was the one and only Nadeko Sengoku from the Monogatari seriesEdit: here\'s another gif cause why not 😌 ***', ' Literally I just wanna kill myself by harakiri, because I have no words for this movie; this is just perfectly a masterpiece! ***', ' this jidaigeki film is so beautifully shot—delightsome cinematography. the technicalities are so ahead of the time. plot is also captivating enough; it skillfully introduces you to the culture of japan back then. you can definitely see that this film serves as a major inspiration to a roster of contemporary filmmakers nowadays. i might watch some samurai films more because of this. ***', ' This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  I actually thought Hanshiro Tsugumo would win the end battle.  ***', "" 100-word review: Rōnin Tsugumo requests to commit harakiri within the manor of a lord, who thinks he's being scammed. Kobayashi's Harakiri — the Letterbox top 250 number three — is a film I inexplicably forgot about having seen twice already, which I'm incredibly thankful for, considering whatever unfathomable reason made it not stick with me before certainly didn't rear its ugly head again. First time giving a samurai film such a positive score, chiefly for finely balancing familiar genre ideas with excellent storytelling, and for being both singularly poignant storywise, and singularly critical of the samurai honour culture, when compared to geo-historical contemporaries. ***""]"

His continued survival amidst the brutal debris of war becomes increasingly nightmarish, a battle between despair and hope.

Unbearable extreme close-ups of its witnesses and beautiful roaming camera moves (ensuring we see even what the characters maybe miss) that in tandem form a series of vivid, unsparing, and surreal vignettes around the psychological experience of unimaginably barbaric horror being made tangible. You can practically smell the mud and fire and corpses, and just like the young boy in this film I too feel like I just aged 100 years in 2 hours. ***', ' One of the greatest films ever made. Period. ***', ' Francois Truffaut once said that it is impossible to make a truly anti-war film, because depictions of war are thrilling by their very nature. I know he said this because I’ve heard it quoted ten thousand times, always by people who are about to name a movie that is an exception to Truffaut’s maxim. Safe to say at this point that he was wrong. Idiot. Let’s ratio him. ***', ' One can’t help but wonder what Taika Waititi would have done with this material ***', ' this makes other WWII movies\xa0look like a ride at disney world ***', "" One of the more upsetting experiences I've had in a long time, and a true document of evil so disturbing, only human beings could fathom such horror.

No thanks 🙈But for real, this film scarred me more than 90% of the horror films I’ve watched so far. It proves that we humans are far worse than we’ve actually thought. ***', ' Years before the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the boundaries within the war genre are pushed one last time. So, even by the 80s, the WWII topic seemed overused, but the approach that Klimov had towards the psychological impact a human soul could possess over consciousness and rationality is breathtaking. Moreover, the last ""flashback"" montage is one of the most intense sequences you will be ever able to see. Instantly, Idi i Smotri belongs to a superior category of cinema with absolutely invigorating imagery and suicidal chaos. It\'s no joyous or action-oriented trip of entertainment: it is authentic horror, flawlessly filmed. Be prepared.99/100 ***', ' makes Saving Private Ryan looks like a child movie ***', ' Seeing this in a theater with other people quietly sniffling during the ending and then everyone getting up to leave the theater in dead silence is an unforgettable experience, not ashamed to admit I was holding back tears during the final moments. ***', ' He looks like Ellen the generous ***']"
