Harakiri,1962,Masaki Kobayashi,"
Down-on-his-luck veteran Tsugumo Hanshirō enters the courtyard of the prosperous House of Iyi. Unemployed, and with no family, he hopes to find a place to commit seppuku—and a worthy second to deliver the coup de grâce in his suicide ritual. The senior counselor for the Iyi clan questions the ronin’s resolve and integrity, suspecting Hanshirō of seeking charity rather than an honorable end. What follows is a pair of interlocking stories which lay bare the difference between honor and respect, and promises to examine the legendary foundations of the Samurai code.

This is remarkable. It’s a film that raises a lot of issues about whether fervent loyalty to the code of honour is more valuable than humanity. And how that is unjustifiable. The execution is masterful, and the pay-off is even better. The resolution is entirely cathartic. It’s also incredibly well-choreographed, touching, and surprisingly exciting. I do think that I will need another watch in order to fully digest everything, though. ***', ' God damn what an impeccable film. Not dated in the least, if you tried to tell this same story now, 60 years later, this would still be the best way to tell it, shot for shot, line for line.I sometimes get intimidated by the fact that there is so much great film, both past and present, that I could never find time to see it all. Japan alone has way too many incredible filmmakers with extensive filmographies I’ve barely scraped the surface of. I don’t know what was in the water over there throughout the 20th century, but it must’ve been good. ***', ' Probably the greatest film ever.. a film about honour, valour, poverty, hunger , justice and the politics.. a fable that is as relevant today as when it was made.. totally blown ***', ' Immediately pulls you in with its captivating simultaneous story-telling, which rings of mystery and intrigue as the plot thickens and builds. There’s so much beauty in intimate and heartbreaking dialogue, and this films display of powerful rhetoric, equally as thoughtful as it can be emotionally jarring, is absolute class. Everything builds as an eerie and heart-pounding score adds layers of uncertainty to an already nervous experience. This all builds to our final few sequences which mesmerized me and solidified Harakiri as not only the greatest samurai film ever made, but one of the best films ever made. ***', ' ""Who can fathom the depths of another man\'s heart?"" ***', ' wait can we normalize calling something you’ve only seen once, your favorite movie of all time? ***', ' Went in with high expectations and boy were they fucking fulfilled. The word masterpiece is thrown around a lot, often too much, but in the case of Harakiri its 110% justified. Simply astonishing. ***', "" it's frankly quite embarrassing how often I find myself at a loss for words, but it's a consolation to know that when this film is concerned, words probably wouldn't even come close to doing it justice anyway ***"", ' ""...a man of some acquaintance to me.""my first masaki kobayashi film dares me to review it, knowing i cant. some shots tell more stories, reveal more history, and immortalize myths better than any scene involving dialogue ever could. i want my heart back, masaki kobayashi. ***', ' a japanese action samurai movie about a dude trying to kill himself the director made this movie for me he told me himself!! ***', "" Ain't got much to say here to be honest. It's just one of the greatest films ever made isn't it?If you've seen it then you know and if you haven't just do yourself a favour and go watch this classic. ***"", ' Both Spider-verses are better than this94/100 ***', ' The resolve of the broken in the face of expiry. A partition of prestige veils the sanctimonious. One man willing to sacrifice his life for his own personal cause; Hanshirō dedicated everything to a morality that ruthlessly betrayed him, and in setting out to take his revenge, he reveals the moral hypocrisies of Bushidō, which prove to be more damning to his antagonists than any amount of malefic bloodshed he could inflict.But blood will be spilled. It will rain crimson at the feet of their Gods, and no attempts at swift concealment can ever suture the gaping wounds revealed by the truth. ***', "" How dare Masaki Kobayashi steal the climatic scene from Kill Bill without giving it credit? What a shameless man. This film should be avoided at all- just joking. Hara-kiri is japanese filmmaking at its best, fascinating use of lighting and music. 20 minutes in and I've already decided that this film is definitely going into my top 10 best films of all time list, exceeding both Seven Samurai and Rashomon. Going to give Takashi Miike's remake a try. I fucking love samurais, man. ***"", ' Great movie but every time they name-dropped the ""Sengoku clan"" all I could think about was the one and only Nadeko Sengoku from the Monogatari seriesEdit: here\'s another gif cause why not 😌 ***', ' Literally I just wanna kill myself by harakiri, because I have no words for this movie; this is just perfectly a masterpiece! ***', ' this jidaigeki film is so beautifully shot—delightsome cinematography. the technicalities are so ahead of the time. plot is also captivating enough; it skillfully introduces you to the culture of japan back then. you can definitely see that this film serves as a major inspiration to a roster of contemporary filmmakers nowadays. i might watch some samurai films more because of this. ***', ' This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  I actually thought Hanshiro Tsugumo would win the end battle.  ***', "" 100-word review: Rōnin Tsugumo requests to commit harakiri within the manor of a lord, who thinks he's being scammed. Kobayashi's Harakiri — the Letterbox top 250 number three — is a film I inexplicably forgot about having seen twice already, which I'm incredibly thankful for, considering whatever unfathomable reason made it not stick with me before certainly didn't rear its ugly head again. First time giving a samurai film such a positive score, chiefly for finely balancing familiar genre ideas with excellent storytelling, and for being both singularly poignant storywise, and singularly critical of the samurai honour culture, when compared to geo-historical contemporaries. ***""]"
Come and See,1985,Elem Klimov,"
The invasion of a village in Byelorussia by German forces sends young Florya into the forest to join the weary Resistance fighters, against his family's wishes.

His continued survival amidst the brutal debris of war becomes increasingly nightmarish, a battle between despair and hope.

So, even by the 80s, the WWII topic seemed overused, but the approach that Klimov had towards the psychological impact a human soul could possess over consciousness and rationality is breathtaking. Moreover, the last ""flashback"" montage is one of the most intense sequences you will be ever able to see.

Masaki Kobayashi feels at home, and it is clearly here where his thematic trademarks had begun evincing. A spectacularly crafted and marvelously shot tale of humanism and moralism, and an incredibly investing protagonist in the form of Kaji, which is impeccably performed by the legendary Tatsuya Nakadai.I will continue with the rest of the trilogy in the forthcoming days. ***', ' A masterpiece. Flawless framing and staging. Sublime performances. Not a single moment wasted. One of the best directed films I’ve ever seen. ***', "" Definitely One of the greatest anti-war Films of all time, i don't know what took me so long to watch this MASTERPIECE...

I can't wait to see the next two films of the trilogy. ***"", "" Masaki Kobayashi's first film of the 10 hour trilogy is a major achievement in cinema. It is long and gruelling, but worth it. Kaji, a labour camp supervisor is tormented by ethics and morals as he struggles to make the decisions required in wartime. Meanwhile he has just married the love of his life. The ending is particular devastating and there are some quite brutal moments.I look forward to the next two chapters. ***"", ' This definitely wasn’t what I was expecting from this film, I was thinking it would be straight into the frontlines guns and explosions and shit but I’m soo glad this film is the way it is. Kaji is so interesting and I’m excited to see where his character goes over the next two films. ***', ' Criterion Challenge 2022 Week 5, Part 1 of 3. The is the first of the Human Condition trilogy and the first film is a masterpiece. One of the best war films amongst Come and See, The Ascent and Ran. The best Japanese war film I’ve seen yet. Masaki Kobayashi is already a favorite director of mine after seeing\xa0Harakiri, Kwaidan and now the first of his war trilogy. The 3 hours and 26 minutes runtime went by in a flash. I don’t want to say much cause this is a movie to experience for yourself. ***', ' Brutal watch. It reminds me of the Book of Job as it’s about a man who is only trying to do good in the face of evil and oppression and yet he only gets punished and beaten by his bosses and betrayed and spit on by his workers. However, he bears it all. It’s a powerful film that is so emotionally gripping that I had to walk away a couple times. I was planning on marathoning the whole trilogy today but I don’t think I can handle it. ***', "" A+Kaji is one of the most intriguing cinematic characters I've ever seen. He embodies the difficulty of upholding one's own personal and humanist values that are at odds with those of a strict and harsh government.Now I need to watch the next one immediately. The film's 3hours and 26 minutes runtime flew by so quickly. I can't wait to see how they explore the themes of morality and humanity further, as well as the character development of Kaji and his struggles between conformity and personal values.(my rating for Part One may or may not change after watching the whole trilogy) ***"", ' The Human Condition: No Greater Love, is so well orchestrated you could almost compare it to the work of Bach, intense and powerful in its tone, with sublime composition. The way Kobayashi is able to permeate his ‘promised’ theme (The Human Condition) throughout the gripping and well paced 3 and a half hours is astonishing, and I can only imagine how great the rest of this trilogy will be. ***', ' For Christmas I got THE HUMAN CONNECTION trilogy from the criterion collection. I’m overwhelmed by how great this is on a massive spectacle. Kobayashi was one of the best directors from Japan and he tackles a very daunting project, a 9 hour anti war film. No Greater Love is part one of this trilogy. It takes its time, which is to be expected for a 3+ hour movie. This is one of only a few non Kurosawa movies that I’ve seen Tatsuya Nakadai in and he’s terrific here. ***', "" Honestly, and I hate to say this, it didn't live up to my expectations; as much as I enjoyed the film I don't believe it was astonishing. I do think the technical aspects of the film are great however it wasnt all that for me. Can't wait to see what part 2 and 3 bringEdit:Fuck this im giving this a 4.5/5 ***"", "" Oh shit, my 2000th film on letterboxd inbound, the third film in Kobayashi's epic will be number 2000. And what a way to celebrate. A cinematic titan, this emphatic humanist drama starts off with a bang. ***""]"

Get them the hell out! ***', ' Brutal, gritty, powerful and political The Battle of Algiers is quite an epic film for 1966.The documentary/newsreels style of filming only makes everything feel more urgent and in your face.

Feels like a documentary in the sense that we understand and maybe even empathize with both the French and Algerians, making their escalating violence against one another increasingly upsetting.

Pontecorvo's sharp camera placement here really highlighted the beauty of algerian architecture. This is a film filled with vigour, power, ambition, made to document, inspire and overwhelm. The film can be both exhausting and exhilarating to sit through, but I feel as if I'm coming out of this emotional journey a different man. ***"", "" Hearing that one music cue for the first time in Inglourious Basterds, your first instinct is that it makes you feel ready to go out and fight Nazis.Hearing it again in Gillo Pontecorvo's The Battle of Algiers you're only setting yourself up for a mortifying war that feels like it's still going on even today.

Not that that lessens any of the film’s power; this has got to be one of the most convincing and passionate films about revolution ever made. ***', ' Magnificent in creating this atmosphere of unease that lays around every corner for the French colonial authorities, combined with a newsreel style and unknown cast of capable actors that gives the film an enveloping realism that makes the emotional highs that much more earned. ***', ' A movie about the violent and passionate energies of revolution that are formed by pent up anxieties surrounding oppression, silence, injustice, colonizing, and established superiority over a people that only wish to exist, pushed so far by the system and the struggle that they can only fight back because it’s the only way they’ll be heard. Something oddly topical about that. ***', "" A sobering, brutally real depiction of revolutionary conflict. The film presents the actions as they are without adding any sentimentality or commentary.

Werckmeister Harmonies,2000,Béla Tarr,"
This story takes place in a small town on the Hungarian Plain. In a provincial town, which is surrounded with nothing else but frost. It is bitterly cold weather — without snow. Even in this bewildered cold hundreds of people are standing around the circus tent, which is put up in the main square, to see — as the outcome of their wait — the chief attraction, the stuffed carcass of a real whale. The people are coming from everywhere. From the neighboring settlings, even from quite far away parts of the country. They are following this clumsy monster as a dumb, faceless, rag-wearing crowd. This strange state of affairs — the appearance of the foreigners, the extreme frost — disturbs the order of the small town. Ambitious personages of the story feel they can take advantage of this situation. The tension growing to the unbearable is brought to explosion by the figure of the Prince, who is pretending facelessness. Even his mere appearance is enough to break loose destructive emotions...

Aspiring to an easy job as personal physician to a wealthy family, Noboru Yasumoto is disappointed when his first post after medical school takes him to a small country clinic under the gruff doctor Red Beard. Yasumoto rebels in numerous ways, but Red Beard proves a wise and patient teacher. He gradually introduces his student to the unglamorous side of the profession, ultimately assigning him to care for a prostitute rescued from a local brothel.

The brigade members Kyon, Yuki Nagato, Mikuru Asahina and Itsuki Koizumi start preparing everything for the party, such as costumes and decorations. But a couple of days later, Kyon arrives at school only to find that Haruhi is missing. Not only that, but Mikuru claims she has never known Kyon before, Koizumi is also missing, and Yuki has become the sole member of the literature club. The SOS Brigade seems to have never existed, nor has Haruhi Suzumiya. No one in the school has ever heard about her… except for Kyon.

Napoleon,1927,Abel Gance,"
A biopic of Napoleon Bonaparte, tracing the Corsican's career from his schooldays (where a snowball fight is staged like a military campaign) to his flight from Corsica, through the French Revolution (where a real storm is intercut with a political storm) and the Terror, culminating in his triumphant invasion of Italy in 1797. Originally intended to be the first of six films, director Abel Gance realized the full project would be nigh impossible, and never raised the money to complete the other five. The film's legendary reputation is due to the astonishing range of techniques that Gance uses to tell his story, culminating in the final twenty-minute triptych sequence, which alternates widescreen panoramas with complex multiple- image montages projected simultaneously on three screens.

A fight for the right of individuality and to love who you please.

Aparajito,1956,Satyajit Ray,"
Aparajito picks up where the first film leaves off, with Apu and his family having moved away from the country to live in the bustling holy city of Varanasi (then known as Benares). As Apu progresses from wide-eyed child to intellectually curious teenager, eventually studying in Kolkata, we witness his academic and moral education, as well as the growing complexity of his relationship with his mother. This tenderly expressive, often heart-wrenching film, which won three top prizes at the Venice Film Festival, including the Golden Lion, not only extends but also spiritually deepens the tale of Apu.
